3.3 Problem Statement 

Manual CT contrast bolus tracking is error-prone and time-consuming, affecting accuracy and 
efficiency. This project develops an AI model to automate tracking, ensuring precision and 
consistency. 

3.4 Objectives 
1. To build a clean and reliable dataset: Collect the dataset and perform data filtering, 
normalization, and preprocessing to prepare it for model training. 
2. To improve diagnostic accuracy: Evaluate the effectiveness of the AI-assisted system in 
improving diagnostic accuracy compared to manual methods. 
3. To develop an AI-powered bolus tracking system: Design and develop an artificial intelligence 
(AI)-powered system to automatically track contrast bolus in CT imaging, reducing errors and 
improving diagnostic accuracy.
