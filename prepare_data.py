# --- Step 1: Load and Fix Data ---
df = pd.read_csv('final_augmented_dataset.csv')

# FIX 1: Clean the 'Age' column
df['Age'] = df['Age'].astype(str).str.replace(r'[Yy]', '', regex=True)

# Convert categorical columns into numeric format

# 'X' is our set of features (the inputs to the model)
X = df_processed.drop('bolus_tracking_time_sec', axis=1)

# Split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing

# Scale the numerical features so they have a similar range

# Fit the scaler ONLY on the training data to avoid data leakage
